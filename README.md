Hi there!

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about pragmatic, rigorous software
craftsmanship. I'm interested in developer tooling and foundational systems,
such as compilers, databases, build systems, text editors, and more.

I'm currently working for [Mercury] from Portland, Oregon in the United States.
